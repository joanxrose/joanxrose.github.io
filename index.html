            <p> My full name is Joan Rose C. Paelden, but you can just call me
                
                <strong>Joan</strong> (or 
                <strong>Jo</strong>,

                if you're feeling lazy)! 
                
                I'm currently a computer science sophomore student in the
                University of the Philippines Los Baños.

                <h2> My fave CMSC class ✶ </h2>
                <p> Since I'm a computer science student, it's only natural 
                    for me to have a favorite CMSC course. For me, it would be
                    <strong>
                        <em>
                            CMSC 22 - Object Oriented Programming.
                        </em>
                    </strong> 
                
                    This one's my favorite simply because I learned 
                    what it's like to program a mini game! It was fun!

                    <br>
                    <br>
                
                    The programming language used in CMSC 22 was Java, but my
                    favorite language still remains to be
                    <strong>
                        <em>
                            Python.
                        </em>
                    </strong>  
                    I just like its simplicity and readability. I liked CMSC 22, 
                    but the Java syntax gave me a headache.
                </p>

            <div class = "right-ge"> 
                <h2> My fave GE class ✶ </h2>
                <p> My favorite GE class would probably be 
                    <strong>
                        Arts 1 - Critical Perspectives in the Arts.
                    </strong>
                    I enjoyed it because my professor's lectures were 
                    really insightful.

                    <br>
                    <br> 

                    I was able to learn so much about what art really is,
                    and how it contributes to the Philippine society.
                    I also enjoyed the discussions I had with my classmates
                    and groupmates!

        <p> Like every Filipino out there, my favorite food is 
            <strong>
                Adobo.
            </strong> 
            I also love eating fruits. My favorites are 
            <strong>
                mangoes
            </strong>

            and

            <strong>
                grapes.
